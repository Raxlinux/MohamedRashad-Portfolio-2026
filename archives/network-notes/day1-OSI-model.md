Day 1: OSI Model & TCP/IP Basics

Summary:

The OSI model is basically the theoretical rulebook for how the world’s networks talk to each other. The ISO folks created it so different tech vendors could actually play nice together. It’s made up of seven layers, ranging from the physical cables at the bottom to the apps you use every day at the top.

Steps Taken:

Deep Dive: Read up on why the OSI model matters for understanding network traffic.


Cisco Prep: Finished Chapter 1 of the Cisco Introduction to Networks.


Video Review: Watched a CCNA prep video to make sure the layers actually stuck.


Lab Setup: Jumped into the "Getting Started" course for Cisco Packet Tracer.

Commands Used:

Packet Tracer Exploration: I poked around the Packet Tracer GUI to see how routers and switches interact.


Simulation Mode: Used this to watch how data moves across different layers in real-time.


Knowledge Checks: Took the quizzes to make sure I wasn't just skimming the material.

Notes & Screenshot:

Attached my handwritten notes and a shot of my first network setup in Packet Tracer.

Lessons Learned:

Theory vs. Practice: OSI is the conceptual map, but TCP/IP is the road we actually drive on.


Data Names: Data changes its "outfit" as it moves; it goes from bits to frames, then packets, then segments, and finally raw data.


The Bridge: The Transport Layer is the real MVP because it bridges the hardware world and the software world.


Error Checking: I learned that while the Data Link and Transport layers both check for errors, the Transport layer is the one making sure everything gets to the final destination correctly.
